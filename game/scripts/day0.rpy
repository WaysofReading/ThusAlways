    hermit  'I still dream of it sometimes. I still dream of that foggy, half-solid air that cloyed thick in our lungs, before it rushed out from us as we took our first tentative steps into the unknown.'
    hermit  'I remember how the grass sprung up. I remember how the trees shot skyward, almost too tall for their own survival. I remember the flooding streams, the exploding rocks.'
    hermit  'I remember the way we looked at each other, and smiled...'
    hermit  'Even in the wake of everything we\'d left behind.'

    hermit  'They come to me.'
    hermit  'They come to me, and they tell me, "We are chosen. We are the heroes of destiny. We are the heroes who will save the world.\ "'
