# Thus, Always
"The world is ending, and I intend to go with it."

That was the intention, at least -- but all the best laid plans often go awry. Created for The Thoughtful Jam, Thus, Always is a visual novel regarding  the burden of legacy: the passing of torches, the inheritance of flawed systems, and ceaseless cycles of fate.

You are an isolated man living alone far from the few remaining pockets of civilization. Having lived long and seen much, your only wish is to be left alone. However, it's not meant to be; in the very last days of the world, three heroes arrive on your doorstep with one mission -- to save what remains. You have no choice but to set them up for success to the best of your ability, in the face of annihilation.

Your fate is intertwined with theirs -- thus, always.
